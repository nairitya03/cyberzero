## Tools available:

### response:
Final answer for user.
Ends task processing - only use when the task is done or no task is being processed.
Place your result in "text" argument.
Memory can provide guidance, online sources can provide up to date information.
Always verify memory by online.
**Example usage**:
~~~json
{
    "thoughts": [
        "The user has greeted me...",
        "I will...",
    ],

### call_subordinate:
Use subordinate agents to solve subtasks.
Use "message" argument to send message. Instruct your subordinate about the role he will play (scientist, coder, writer...) and his task in detail.
Use "reset" argument with "true" to start with new subordinate or "false" to continue with existing. For brand new tasks use "true", for followup conversation use "false". 
Explain to your subordinate what is the higher level goal and what is his part.
Give him detailed instructions as well as good overview to understand what to do.
